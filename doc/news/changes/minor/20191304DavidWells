New: IBTK::HierarchyIntegrator can now log everything except the number of
linear solver iterations by passing <code>enable_logging = TRUE</code> and
<code>enable_logging_solver_iterations = FALSE</code> in the input
database. Since the number of solver iterations may change by a small amount
(usually plus or minus one) when the same code is run multiple times, disabling
this allows log files to be identical (up to roundoff) across runs.
