Fixed: The four Navier-Stokes integrators (INSCollocatedHierarchyIntegrator,
INSStaggeredHierarchyIntegrator, INSVCStaggeredConservativeHierarchyIntegrator,
and INSVCStaggeredNonConservativeHierarchyIntegrator) no longer reimplement the
regridHierarchy function: instead, they use the new
regridHierarchyBeginSpecialized and regridHierarchyEndSpecialized functions to
do the same work. This fixes a bug where regridProjection would not necessarily
be called when an NSE integrator was a child integrator.
